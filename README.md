# MusicSequence

A few examples for my blog post on using the Core Audio AudioToolbox in Swift.

It's a really leaky API - you need to do Core Foundation to do simple things.
It doesn't look like you can use AVFoundation to do these things yet though. 
Things like accessing MIDI events in a sequence for example.


## Blog post for this example.
